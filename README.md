**Skills demonstrated in project:**
* inclusion and use of supplemental JavaScript library (Moment.js)
  * experience with time/date math
  * experience maintaining values based on current/changing time
  * experience with time/date formats  
* inclusion and use of persistent data storage using Firebase
    * experience with database design, what to store/what not to store
    * linking to database
    * read/write/remove data in database

**Goals of program:**
* display a list of trains in a table, with data related to each train 
  * (train name, destination, frequency, next arrival and minutes away)
* store selected data related to each train in Firebase database for persistence
* allow user to enter new trains that display in real time in the displayed train list
* calculate Next Arrival and Minutes Away time, update display based on current time

**To run program:**
* open the index.html file in the browser
* any previously entered train data will be displayed via Firebase database
* to add new train, enter data into form, click submit
  * Train Name
  * Destination
  * First Train Time in military time
